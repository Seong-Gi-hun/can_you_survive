You've found the recruiter's secret repository. But can you find the true reward?  

> "The game is simple, yet the stakes are high. Only those who see beyond the code will survive."  

Look deeper into the **commits**, the **branches**, or maybe an ignored file?  

🔺⭕⬛  

_The key lies within..._  


🎭 **A mysterious recruiter has hidden a secret within this repository.**  
Only those who can **see beyond the surface** will uncover the truth.  

🔺 **The Invitation Has Been Sent** ⭕  
You received a **mysterious card** with three shapes. A number was on the back.  
You called, you accepted the challenge… and now, the game begins.  

💀 **But not everyone will survive.**  

### 🔍 **YOUR MISSION:**  
1️⃣ **Find the Recruiter’s Identity** – A name is hidden, but where?  
2️⃣ **Search the Repository for Clues** – Not all files are in plain sight.  
3️⃣ **Follow the Trail of Commits and Branches** – The past holds secrets.  
4️⃣ **Locate the Hidden Flag** – Only the worthy will claim it.  

🚀 **WHERE TO START?**  
📌 **Check the metadata** – Something might be hiding in the **image file**.  
📌 **Investigate commit history** – (`git log`, `git show <commit-id>`)  
📌 **Explore different branches** – (`git branch -a`, `git checkout <branch>`)  
📌 **Look for hidden files** – (`ls -la`, `.gitignore`, or `.gitkeep`)  

### 🔥 **HINTS:**  
- The recruiter left traces in **previous commits**—but did they erase them all?  
- Some secrets are **ignored but not forgotten**—check `.gitignore`.  
- A **deleted message might still exist**—find it.  

🎭 **Only the observant will pass this challenge. Will you?**  

🔺⭕⬛  

💀 _The key lies within… but can you find it before it’s too late?_ 💀
